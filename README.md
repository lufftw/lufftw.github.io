## 中文介紹

我是一名以軟體工程與演算法為核心背景的開發者，長期關注系統設計、資料結構與演算法實務，以及研究導向的工程問題。本網站作為個人技術博客，主要用來整理與記錄我在實際專案、研究與自我訓練過程中的思考與筆記。

內容涵蓋演算法解題策略、系統架構設計、工程實務經驗，以及對新工具與新技術的分析與評估。文章多以「可長期維護、可重現、可理解」為核心原則，避免只停留在速成解法或片段結論，而是嘗試說清楚問題背景、設計取捨與實作細節。

這個博客同時也是一個個人知識整理空間，用來將零散的學習經驗逐步結構化，並作為未來回顧與延伸的基礎。若你對軟體工程、演算法、或研究與實務交會的議題感興趣，希望這裡的內容能對你有所幫助。

## English Introduction

I am a developer with a core background in software engineering and algorithms, with long-term interests in system design, data structures, algorithmic practice, and research-oriented engineering problems. This website serves as a personal technical blog for organizing and documenting my thoughts and notes from real-world projects, research activities, and self-directed training.

The content covers algorithmic problem-solving strategies, system architecture design, practical engineering experience, as well as analysis and evaluation of new tools and technologies. Most articles are written with an emphasis on long-term maintainability, reproducibility, and clarity, rather than focusing solely on quick solutions or isolated conclusions. Whenever possible, I aim to clearly explain the problem context, design trade-offs, and implementation details.

This blog also functions as a personal knowledge organization space, where fragmented learning experiences are gradually structured and refined, serving as a foundation for future review and extension. If you are interested in software engineering, algorithms, or topics at the intersection of research and practice, I hope you will find the content here helpful.
